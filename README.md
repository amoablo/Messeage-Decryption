# Messeage-Decryption
Using RSA algorithm to break each encryption to figure out the code for the files

The super-secret shady government organization (SSSGO) that you work for has received 
a tip from their agents (spies) in the field that there will be a terror attack somewhere inland 
between February 1st and February 15th 11:00 PM. Your team has received two files and some 
information about them. The files are password protected and the clues received by our agents are 
encrypted. Your Job is to break the encryption crack the password and pray something in those 
files lead us to the bomb before time expires.

Mission 1 â€“ Decrypt the message!
The analysts intercepted some chatter on the dark web and sent it over to us. we believe 
that this is some sort of encrypted code, used to access the files you received. The numbers appear 
in groups of threes. We strongly believe that the first number is the actual cyphertext (c), while the 
second and third make up the public key for each group.
The perps are using RSA. We are almost sure of it given that it is the most widely used public key 
encryption algorithm. Use your knowledge of the RSA algorithm to break each encryption to figure out the
code for the files. Remember to check in with the operation manager (OM) frequently for updates from the 
field.
Cyphertext (c) 
Public Key (Puk) = {17, 2173}
